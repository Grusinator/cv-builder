\cvsubsection{Summary}

% \cvevent{}{}{}{}
I have been working on various projects ranging from backenddevelopment to data engineering to data analysis. 
Mostly withinengineering and energy sectors. 
I have a bit of GIS experience fromvarious projects, well supported by my education in data processingwithin geospatial and remote sensing diciplines. 
Now adays its hardto not get a bit of cloud and devops under the skin as well. 
I am quite adaptive in terms of skills and competences, and not afraid to start out something that i might not know much about. 
In terms of personality, according to the "Insights" profile test, i am the "Helping Inspirer". 
creative, energetic and currious type. Sometimes a bit too quick and intuitive. But it has its qualities too.
